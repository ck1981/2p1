The root `web/wp-config.php` is required by WordPress and is only used to load the other main configs. Nothing else should be added to it.

`config/application.php` is the main config file that contains what `wp-config.php` usually would. Base options should be set in there.

For environment specific configuration, use the files under `config/environments`. By default there's is `development`, `staging`, and `production` but these can be whatever you require.

The environment configs are required **before** the main `application` config so anything in an environment config takes precedence over `application`.

Note: You can't re-define constants in PHP. So if you have a base setting in `application.php` and want to override it in `production.php` for example, you have a few options:

* Remove the base option and be sure to define it in every environment it's needed
* Only define the constant in `application.php` if it isn't already defined.
